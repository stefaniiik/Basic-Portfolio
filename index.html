    <p class=bio>
    I am originally from Chicago, IL and I went to university at Northern Illinois
     in DeKalb. I have a twin sister, who's name in Amanda and she lives in Northern Pheonix. 
     I also have an older brother who currently resides in Central Lake, MI. I have lived
     in Tempe coming up on a year in May; however, I have been visiting Arizona for the last twenty or so 
     years. I will be turning 27 at the end of May.

     I currently work for an auto warranty company in their accounts payable department, and while
     I enjoy the people I work with, I am looking for a career change. I have my BA in English
     and a minor in Communications. I have decided to puruse this coding certificate because I believe it will 
     provide me with enough challenges to keep me interested in the work I am doing. I also believe it will 
     provide a certain type of gratification because I will be creating things, and working towards something with 
     a purpose.

    In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, watching Netflix, and doing yoga. One of the hiking trails I like to go to
    is the Marcos De Niza Trail at South Mountain. I am always on the look out for true crime documentaries and true crime
    docu-series. My favortie authors include John Green and Stephen King, even though they write two completely diferent genres
    within fiction writing.
