    <p id="about">I am originally from Chicago, IL and I went to university at Northern Illinois
     in DeKalb. I have a twin sister, who's name in Amanda and she lives in Northern Pheonix. 
     I also have an older brother who currently resides in Central Lake, MI. I have lived
     in Tempe coming up on a year in May; however, I have been visiting Arizona since I was about 
     five years old. I will be turning 27 at the end of May.
     <br>
     I currently work for an auto warranty company in their accounts payable department, and while
     I enjoy the people I work with, I am definitely looking for a career change. I have my BA in English
     and a minor in Communications, so as you can tell, I'm not committed to anything just yet. I have decided
     to puruse this coding certificate because I believe it will provide me with enough challenges to keep
     me interested in the work I am doing. I also believe it will provide a certain time of gratification because
     I will be creating this, and working towards something for a purpose. </p>
